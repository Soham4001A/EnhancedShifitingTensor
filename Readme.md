# Readme

## Overview
This project demonstrates dynamic memory address manipulation using a combination of C++ and assembly language. The primary goal is to showcase techniques for real-time memory relocation, adaptive memory management, dynamic data protection, and performance optimization.

## File Structure
- **HighLevelIntegration.cpp**: Contains the main C++ code that interacts with the assembly functions.
- **Init.asm**: Contains initial setup and example functions for memory manipulation.
- **tensor.asm**: Contains the core assembly functions for tensor initialization, memory shifting, data protection, and data access.
- **Readme.md**: This file.

## Assembly Functions

### tensor.asm
- **init_tensor**: Initializes the tensor array to zero.
- **shift_memory**: Shifts memory by storing new data at a specified index.
- **protect_data**: Protects data by masking it at a specified index.
- **access_data**: Accesses data quickly from the specified index.

### Init.asm
- **_start**: Demonstrates initial memory manipulation operations including shifting, rewriting, protecting, and accessing data.

## C++ Integration

### HighLevelIntegration.cpp
- **init_tensor**: Initializes the tensor array.
- **shift_memory**: Shifts memory by storing new data at a specified index.
- **protect_data**: Protects data by masking it at a specified index.
- **access_data**: Accesses data quickly from the specified index.

## Main Function
- Initializes the tensor.
- Shifts memory by storing value 1 at index 2.
- Rewrites memory by moving the value at index 2 to index 8.
- Protects data by masking it at index 4.
- Accesses data by retrieving the value at index 8.
- Prints the entire tensor to verify the changes.

## Compilation and Execution

### Assembly Files
To compile the assembly files, use `nasm`:

```sh
nasm -f elf64 -o tensor.o tensor.asm
nasm -f elf64 -o init.o Init.asm
```

### C++ File
To compile the C++ file and link it with the assembly object files, use `g++`:

```sh
g++ -o main HighLevelIntegration.cpp tensor.o init.o
```

### Run the Executable
```sh
./main
```

## Output
The program will output the accessed data at index 8 and print the entire tensor array to verify the changes.

## Concepts

### Real-Time Relocation
Dynamically relocating memory addresses to optimize data layout in memory on-the-fly.

### Adaptive Memory Management
Changing the memory allocation strategy based on the current state and needs of the application.

### Dynamic Data Protection
Protecting sensitive data by moving it to memory regions with stricter access controls or masking it dynamically.

### Performance Optimization
Optimizing memory layout for performance by ensuring that the most frequently accessed data is located in the fastest memory regions.

## Benefits
- Enhanced system efficiency and responsiveness.
- Improved data security.
- Better performance, especially in real-time systems.
