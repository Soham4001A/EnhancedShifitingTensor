# Shifting Tensor: A Dynamic Pipelined Approach to Matrix Multiplication

This repository contains a high-performance C++ implementation of a novel matrix multiplication (GEMM) kernel. It's designed to explore an alternative to the traditional "pre-packing" method used in standard libraries like OpenBLAS and MKL.

Our approach, the **"Pipelined Shifting Tensor,"** is engineered for scenarios where the weight matrix is dynamic, frequently updated, or used only once, making the high upfront cost of pre-packing undesirable. This is particularly relevant for research in areas like continual learning, online model adaptation, and dynamic network pruning.

## The Core Idea: Explained in Two Ways

### 1. The Non-Technical Analogy: Two Master Chefs

Imagine a master chef (our **CPU**) who needs to prepare hundreds of complex dishes. The recipes are in a giant, heavy cookbook (the **Weight Matrix `W`**).

*   **The Standard Library Chef (`Packed` Approach):** This chef is methodical. They spend a full day before service **photocopying and reorganizing every single recipe** into a perfectly ordered personal binder. Once this massive setup is done, they can cook with lightning speed. This is incredibly efficient if they cook the same menu for a year. But if the menu changes daily, they waste a lot of time on setup.

*   **Our Shifting Tensor Chef (`Pipelined` Approach):** This chef is agile. They keep the main cookbook on the shelf. They hire a **helper assistant (a persistent helper thread)**. As the chef starts preparing the current dish, they tell the assistant, "Go get me the *next* recipe page." The assistant runs, finds the page, and has it ready the exact moment the chef needs it. There is **zero setup time**, and the kitchen is always ready for a new, surprise menu. This is the essence of our pipelined approachâ€”overlapping the "fetching" of data with the "cooking" of it.

### 2. The Technical Deep Dive

The `Packed` approach, used by virtually all high-performance libraries, solves the memory latency problem by performing a one-time, expensive transpose of the entire `W` matrix into a CPU-cache-friendly format. This cost is then amortized over many computations, especially large batches.

Our `forward_pipelined_v3` kernel challenges this by asking: "Can we achieve competitive performance *without* the upfront packing cost?"

It achieves this through three key mechanisms:
1.  **On-the-Fly Shifting:** Instead of packing the whole `W` matrix, we "shift" (transpose and copy) only the tiny vertical panels of `W` that we need for the immediate next step of the computation.
2.  **Persistent Helper Thread:** To avoid the high cost of spawning threads in a tight loop (`std::async`), we create a single, persistent worker thread at the start of the function. This thread's only job is to perform the "shifting" of the next data panel.
3.  **True Compute/Memory Overlap:** Using a mutex and condition variables, the main thread computes on the *current* data panel (`w_compute_buf`) while simultaneously signaling the helper thread to begin shifting the *next* panel into a secondary buffer (`w_shift_buf`). This hides the memory access latency behind the compute work.
4.  **Vectorized Shifting & Prefetching:** The shifting operation itself is accelerated using AVX2 intrinsics. We also use `_mm_prefetch` to hint to the CPU to start fetching data for panel `N+2` while the pipeline is working on panels `N` (compute) and `N+1` (shifting).

## How to Build and Run

The code is written in C++20 and uses platform-specific SIMD intrinsics and threading. Make sure you have a modern C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

#### Linux / macOS
You will need to link the `pthread` library for `std::thread` support.
```sh
g++ -O3 -std=c++20 -march=native -pthread -o shift main.cpp
```

#### Windows
Use a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt. The `/arch:AVX2` flag is critical.
```sh
cl.exe /O2 /EHsc /std:c++20 /arch:AVX2 /Fe:shift.exe main.cpp
```

#### Running the Benchmark
```sh
./shift
```

## Benchmark Results & Analysis

The program benchmarks the `Packed` (library-style) approach against our `Pipelined V3` approach across several scales.

**Sample Output on an AVX2-capable Machine:**

--- Running at Scale: 2x (B=512, I=8192, O=8192) ---
Benchmarking 'Packed' (Library-style) Approach...
Benchmarking 'Enhanced Pipelined (V3)' Approach...

--- Results (Scale 2x) ---
Packed (Library Style)       : 134.95 GFLOP/s
Enhanced Pipelined (V3 Idea) : 131.23 GFLOP/s

Speed-up of V3 Pipelined vs Packed: 0.97x
```
*(Note: Your results will vary based on CPU architecture, core count, and memory speed.)*

**Analysis:**
The results show that the `Pipelined V3` approach is **highly competitive** with the gold-standard `Packed` method, often achieving >95% of its performance. This is a significant achievement because our method completely avoids the large memory footprint and upfront computational cost of pre-packing the entire weight matrix.

This validates the core hypothesis: for single-pass inference or dynamic-weight scenarios, an on-the-fly pipelined approach can be a highly effective alternative to static pre-packing.

## Architectural Evolution

This project was built iteratively based on performance analysis and feedback.
*   **V1:** A simple sequential pipeline that re-shifted data for every batch item. It was slow due to massive redundant work.
*   **V2:** Used `std::async` to introduce true concurrency and amortized the shifting cost by changing the loop order. It was much faster but suffered from high thread-creation overhead.
*   **V3 (Current):** Implemented a persistent helper thread to eliminate thread overhead and vectorized the shifting logic, bringing performance nearly on par with the pre-packed standard.

## Future Work & Improvements

This implementation serves as a strong proof-of-concept. The following are clear next steps for research and development:
1.  **Outer-Loop Parallelization:** Parallelize the outermost `o_base` loop using OpenMP (`#pragma omp parallel for`) to scale performance across multiple CPU cores.
2.  **Adaptive Blocking:** Make the `I_BLOCK` size tunable at runtime based on the machine's L1/L2 cache sizes for better portability.
3.  **Lower Precision Support:** Implement BF16/INT8 variants using AVX512-VNNI or other specialized instructions to explore the trade-offs in modern ML inference.
4.  **Integration with a Dynamic Model:** Connect this kernel to a model where weights are actively pruned or updated to demonstrate the real-world advantages of avoiding a stale packed buffer.
